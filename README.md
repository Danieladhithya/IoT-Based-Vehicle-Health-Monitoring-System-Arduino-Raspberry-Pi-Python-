## Project Overview

This project combines **ESP32-based sensor telemetry, embedded firmware, a Flask web dashboard, and a Random Forest ML model** to predict vehicle faults, battery degradation, and remaining useful life (RUL). The system supports both **local alerts** (LCD + buzzer) and **remote alerts** via a Telegram bot.

---

## Key Features

* Real-time telemetry collection from ESP32 sensors (temperature, vibration, RPM).
* ML-based predictions for vehicle faults and battery health using Random Forest.
* Web dashboard built with Flask, Jinja2, and Bootstrap for real-time visualization.
* Dual notifications: local (LCD + buzzer) and remote (Telegram Bot).
* Data persistence via SQLite for lightweight storage.
* Embedded firmware in Arduino (C/C++) with wireless communication using Zigbee.

## Architecture & Components

### Hardware

* **ESP32:** IoT data collection and transmission.
* **Sensors:** DHT11 (temperature/humidity), ADXL345 (accelerometer), Oil level sensor.
* **Power:** 12V lead-acid battery (target for BMS predictions).
* **UI:** LCD + Buzzer for local alerts.
* **Communication:** Zigbee mesh network, Telegram Bot for remote alerts.

### Software

* **Embedded:** Arduino IDE (C/C++) for ESP32 firmware.
* **Backend:** Flask (Python) with Jinja2 templates.
* **Frontend:** HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery for UI and charts.
* **Database:** SQLite for lightweight storage.
* **Machine Learning:** Random Forest (training using scikit-learn in Jupyter Notebook).
* **Notifications:** Telegram Bot API.

---

## Machine Learning Model

* **Algorithm:** Random Forest (ensemble).
* **Use Cases:** Predict vehicle faults, battery degradation, and estimate RUL.
* **Input Features:** Cycle index, discharge times, voltage/current readings, time-at-voltage, etc.

This version is **clean, structured, and easy to read** for GitHub visitors.

If you want, I can also make a **shorter, “resume-style” README version** that’s even cleaner for recruiters or casual viewers.

Do you want me to do that?
